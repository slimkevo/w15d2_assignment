# w15d2_assignment

Report

Design:

Used an array that uses chaining to handle collision.
Used insert, get, remove, and resize operations.

Text Preprocessing:

Removed punctuation and converted text to lowercase.

Counting Frequencies:

Inserted words into the hash table and updated their counts.

Overall Time Complexity: 

The time complexity of my solution, considering all operations, is 
O(nlogn).

Space Complexity Analysis:

The space complexity is O(n) for storing n key-value pairs in the hash table, plus the overhead of the lists used for chaining.
